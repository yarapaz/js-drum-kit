# 🥁 JavaScript - Octapad

![Js Octapad Preview](./docs/assets/images/js-octapad-preview.jpg)

Welcome to the JS Octapad project! This project aim was to build a fully operative Octapad just by using **HTML, CSS (developed using Sass), JavaScript and Gulp.**

An Octapad is an electronic percussion instrument which has eight rubber pads on a rectangular surface. These rubber pads produce sounds when they are struck on.

In this case, as we wanted to reproduce a complete drum kit we have added an extra pad. That means we have one more sound to be played to complete our drums.
